# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project

Wrote SQL queries to analyze a digital music store database, uncovering insights on customer behavior, top artists, popular genres, and revenue trends. Implemented joins, CTEs, and window functions to answer business-driven questions like highest spenders, most popular tracks, and country-wise music preferences.

I used SQL queries to explore customer behavior, sales trends, and music preferences.

 # Key highlights:

     - Found the senior-most employee and top-spending customers

     - Identified the most revenue-generating cities and countries

     - Listed top 10 rock artists and tracks longer than the average

     - Analyzed customer spending on top-selling artists

     - Discovered the most popular music genre in each country

     - The project uses joins, CTEs, and window functions to answer business-driven questions and demonstrate practical SQL skills.
